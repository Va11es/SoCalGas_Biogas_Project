# SoCalGas_Biogas_Project

## Overview  
This project explores the feasibility of establishing a waste-to-energy program in alignment with California’s ambitious climate goals and policies. The study evaluates the potential for utilizing renewable natural gas (RNG) and other low-carbon fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable energy solutions.  

The study focuses on the 91768 zip code, with a roadmap designed to assist other institutions in replicating similar programs.  

## Background  
### California Climate Goals and Policies  
SoCalGas seeks to advance the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels (e.g., RNG, hydrogen) to meet California’s climate targets, which include:  
- **SB 32**: Statewide greenhouse gas reduction of 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.  
- **SB 1383**: Reduction of methane by 40%, hydrofluorocarbon gases by 40%, and anthropogenic carbon by 50% by 2030.  
- **SB 100**: Achieve 60% renewable electricity by 2030.  
- **Executive Order B-55-18**: Achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.  
- **AB 1826**: Implement mandatory organic waste recycling programs at the local level.  

### Methods to Achieve Emission Goals  
1. **Waste-to-Energy**: Conversion of waste into RNG or other renewable fuels.  
2. **Low-Carbon and Zero-Carbon Fuel Use**: Deployment of RNG or hydrogen in transportation.  
3. **Energy Resiliency**: Utilizing fuel cells, RNG-powered backup generators, and related technologies.  

## Opportunity  
Technologies to implement waste-to-energy, low-carbon fuel, and energy resiliency strategies exist and can scale to meet California’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals. However, there is a need for sound business cases and feasibility studies to help stakeholders understand the requirements, impacts, economics, and policies necessary for adoption and sustainability.  

## Proposed Project Objectives  
This project, supported by SoCalGas, aims to:  
1. Assess the feasibility of establishing a pilot waste-to-energy program in the 91768 zip code using a local digester.  
2. Develop a business case for the pilot program implementation.  
3. Publish a roadmap for replicating similar programs at other universities and institutions.  

### Specific Objectives  
- Identify a suitable location for the pilot program.  
- Assess potential organic waste volumes available for conversion.  
- Determine the economic “breakeven” point for the project.  
- Create a business case for the program’s sustainability.  
- Estimate the amount of traditional natural gas that could be displaced across all California State University campuses with on-site biodigesters or thermal conversion technologies.  
- Identify the necessary permits for program implementation.  
- Develop a comprehensive manual to guide other universities in implementing similar programs.  

## Key Deliverables  
1. **Feasibility Study**: Detailed analysis of waste-to-energy pilot program potential.  
2. **Business Case**: Comprehensive financial and operational plan for implementation.  
3. **Scalability Roadmap**: Step-by-step guide for replicating the program at other institutions.  
4. **Implementation Manual**: Practical document for universities to follow when setting up similar programs.
